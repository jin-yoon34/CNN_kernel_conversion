# CNN_kernel_conversion for CT images
CNN caffe pre-trained network for converting between B30 (1S1) and B70 (1L1) and vice-versa

The credit for the CNN model goes to Choe et al (2019).
The original github post with the source code and instructions can be found at https://github.com/leegaeun/CT_Kernel_Conversion [1]

The pretrained network was trained using repeat CT Lung images (kernel B70) that are publicly available on the TCIA at https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/RIDER+Lung+CT#2251273279368e51be0f4512a5934daff0cfe302 [2]
and their counterpart images (kernel B30), which are being prepared for upload to the TCIA.
